## Overview

Recently we had an incident where sewer gas had forced it's way into the house. Among the question of how this happened was the obvious question "Is the aerobic septic system working?" Having recently found the joy of IoT that the ESP8266 and ESP32 bring with the ease of programming like an Arduino and simplified connection to Wi-Fi and the Internet I thought "My dishwasher, pet feeder, vacuum, and light switches are all connected to the Internet, why not my septic system!"

Thus the birth of this project which will look at monitoring an existing mechanical system (AC sensing), logging usage data and alerting system failures all through a Wi-Fi Internet connection. 

### What is an Aerobic Septic System

An an Aerobic Septic System, also referred to as an Aerobic Wastewater Treatment System, is a small-scale sewage treatment system similar to a septic tank, but which uses an aerobic process (adding air or oxygen) for digestion rather than the anaerobic (without air) process used in septic systems.

Adding air promotes the growth of organisms that break down the solids, which are put through a clarifier and chlorinated for disinfection which produces a cleaner, more environmentally friendly discharge. This cleaner discharge eliminates the need for a drainage field (leach field) allowing the system to be installed on a small property where a standard septic tank system would not have been possible.
